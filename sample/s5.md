I strongly recommend against using any `<blink>` tags.

I wish SmartyPants used named entities like `&mdash;`
instead of decimal-encoded entites like `&#8212;`.


If you want your page to validate under XHTML 1.0 Strict,
you've got to put paragraph tags in your blockquotes:

<blockquote>
<p>For example.</p>
</blockquote>
